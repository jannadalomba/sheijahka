The April Fools post above reminded me very much of last year's Indianapolis hamfest. As part of the fest, they were giving away a Baofeng or TaiSungPowKai somethingorother dual bander every 30 minutes for the entire day as a door prize, and had 1 big prize at the end of the day. While walking around the flea market, I overheard someone vehemently explaining to his friend that if he won one of those, he would "take it out of the box and smash it on the concrete in front of everyone". –ü—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä—ã Pentium 4 –¥–ª—è –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤ (¬´–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ¬ª), –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –¥–ª—è –Ω–æ—É—Ç–±—É–∫–æ–≤ (¬´–º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ¬ª), –≤—ã–ø—É—Å–∫–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ —Ç—Ä—ë—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–∏–ø–∞—Ö –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å–æ–≤.
