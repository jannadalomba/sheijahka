                            <p>Да нормальный патч, хуже по крайней мере не делает и fps не отнимает, возможно даже прибавляет какой-то минимум, а возможно это плацебо. I am fairly new to modding, I started with new vegas about a month ago, and just got skyrim SE on Wednesday. I just figured out how to install ENB (which was harder to find out than it should have been) Here are a few screenshots (imgur wouldn't let me make an album) Here is my mod order A screenshot of my skyrim folder 
So I have no clue what happened. The last time I played Skyrim was in the Summer, though I remember I installed a big mod in between then and now. I dont remember what its called (some ENB one I think). So I wanted to play Skyrim, it booted up and I clicked on continue, crashed right away. I watched some videos and read forums, did some stuff and now it shows the loading screen when I click continue, for less than a second and it crashes. My boot order is all correct. Can anyone help me please. Title. I want to make my own ENB after not being quite satisfied with other ENB presets. Is there someplace I could learn. # Known issues in Ult Sky 4.0.3 / 4.0.4 This list includes all the confirmed reports on the #ultsky-known-bugs Discord channel (https://discordapp.com/invite/8VkDrfq), and a few other items. I tried to sort the list by severity/priority. If you think you may have found a bug, or if you are having issues of any kind, check the pinned messages on the #ultsky-support channel and ask for help there. Also do a quick search in the #ultsky-known-bugs and #ultsky-bug-sub. 
# Skyrim VR - High Fidelity ENB v1.0 by SGS My main goals in making this ENB was realism, good performance, and visual clarity. I made it a while ago but haven't shared it because i felt that it needed a bit more tweaking, particularly with the day/night time separation settings. I recently sold my Vive and won't be able to properly adjust the settings until i get a new HMD. A new HMD will likely require slightly different settings than the Vive to get the contrast and light. I did some research and pretty much know how it works now. One strange thing stood out, however. The latest ENBoost (6) says enb series says .303 or higher, and the ENB preset I want (True Vision) says to go for. 292 (optimised). The enboost page on the nexus says the memory patch requires 303 but the enbdev site saya its just an upgraded memory patch (more stability, less performance). Will I have to search for a preset with a newer series its optimised for, or is 292 perfectly fine? I am getting abnormally low fps on skyrim after installing the latests enb stuff for skyrim (0.377 wrapper, moved the host.exe, local.ini, and d3d9.dll to skyrim folder, not using a preset ). I'm talking 30-35 fps indoors , sometimes dipping to 25 outdoors  This seemed extreme since I used to run some mods on skyrim thorugh nmm on this same laptop (the wrapper version foes detect my dedicated graphics card) without enboost and could get 45 outside and could often get close to 60 inside. The instructions for ENB for SkyrimVR ( say to copy all the files in WrapperVersion into the game directory (this includes the .dll files and .fx files), but any Skyrim SE ENB preset you download will instruct you to only copy the .dll files. Which is correct when installing for SkyrimVR? What's also confusing is that the .fx files for the ENB for SkyrimVR are located in the game directory, but the .fx files for Skyrim  I'm trying to download ENBSeries v0.366 (https://enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0366.htm) but every time I click the download (https://enbdev.com/enbseries_skyrim_v0366.zip) button, it takes me to this trap page ( I've tried everything; Refresh, F5, Ctrl-F5, Clearing cache, Clearing cookies, but to no avail. Does anyone know what's going on? Also, each linked text is whatever the site had linked me to. Instead of posting screenshots, i figured it'd be easier i just started the preperations for the download of the mods. Step five is to install the enb binaries. But with the provided download link and picture where the download button should be i cant find an download button. I find nowhere on this site an actual download button. could somebody point out where it is or post an better link to find it? help would be appreciated :) Instructions from Ultimateskyrim.com (https://Ultimateskyrim.com) : STEP FIVE: INSTALL ENB BINARIES. 
In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought I'd make a list of some of my favorite modders and what makes them so great. I won't be able to get everyone, so if you're not on here, don't worry, it doesn't mean I'm not thankful for you.

Attempting to download the ENB from the site redirects me here: Can't seem to download Skyrim's either. Any way I can bypass Hi everyone. First of all, this is my first time trying an ENB. I likely did something wrong, but for the sake of this post I ultimately do NOT want to even install an ENB, I just want to know how to properly uninstall it and fix my game, as it's still crashing at startup. The ENB I was trying to install was ( which, bc I am an idiot, didn't think to check if there was an SE version (it was on someone. 
Okay, I'm trying to set up Mod Organizer, I'm currently trying to set up ENBOrganizer- I've been using the beginner guide found in the sidebar, which sent me to a guide on installing the ENBOrganizer as well as ENBoost (link: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/enb). I can launch the ENBOrganizer from the ENBOrganizer.exe , however it won't launch via Mod Organizer, giving me this error message: >"failed to inject dll into "ENB ORganizer.exe": failed to access thread context. Please. Okay I think I have this whole thing down pat now. Anyways, trying to play Skyrim and having some problems. In short It tends to be: \- Textures randomly go black and glossy. \- Frequent CTD in tandem with the texture glitch. Especially around Whiterun exterior. I know what you're thinking, "Your ram sucks." Maybe! But I have been sorting through guides regarding this for days and nothing seems to work. I've used LOOT and looked through enbdevs'. My skyrim sky is too dark when i load up the game with this enb. I tried configuring the enb menu in-game. that didn't work. I have the latest ENBdev files also. Please help!

(Having issues setting up ENB) Hello everyone, my first time posting here so I appreciate any positive feedback and support! Like many of you I love skyrim and playing with mods. I'm having an isssue getting ENB to work with Skyrim VR and I'm going to give you guys as much information as possible. I tried downloading multiple versions ENB and it loads up and shows on the top left that ENB is activated but the game doesn't 
Short and sweet, I love and support Nexus, but I'm looking for a list of sites I should spend the time to peruse. Feel free to add to the sites below in your replies, however I am specifically only looking for sites that feature Skyrim SE mods. several modders on Patreon for example only focus on LE, which I don't use. Thanks in advance -- Coins to any who suggest a site I actually download mods from! Nexus - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition (https. This is sort of a repost from r/SkyrimMods \-- Original Post (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/ahiws3/looking_for_nonnexus_se_mod_sites_trying_to/). I'm posting it here specifically since some folks may not actually check the other r/, even though it seem to be the more popular one. Again, as I say below, I'm really just trying to expand my library of links and do it in a way that others can use as well. Short and sweet, I love and support Nexus, but I'm looking. I nuked all my Skyrim saves and mod organizers and mods today so I could start from scratch. Going through the tutorial from the side bar, it's all going ok, I hope, until I get to the ENB part. One, I still don't understand what ENB means or why I really want it but that's more immaterial. The real issue is that both enbhost.exe and d3d9.dll are not in the folder I downloaded today. I downloaded version 371 from I do have enblocal.ini but the only dll file in there is d3d11. When I saw that Skyrim VR was announced, I was excited as hell to be able to experience the World of Skyrim first hand. I had over 1000 hours in the pancake version, most of those using and adjusting with an ENB shader of some sort. When Boris V. first created the ENB shader, I was enthralled at the lighting possibilities. I do lighting for T.V and film for a living, so to be able to take my favorite game and play with making it close to photoreal was exciting, The screen shots we were making.
